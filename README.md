Sample Subset Optimization
==========================

Hi all, 

I'm trying to migratie all my GoogleCode projects to github since GoogleCode does not support uploading source files and executables anymore...

Imbalanced Data Sampling Using Sample Subset Optimization



New updates for imbalanced sampling program provides a GUI interface. The new program called "SSOgui.jar" is available from the download tab. Just double click it to run if you have Java installed in your computer. The dataset "exampleData.txt" could be used to test the program. When using your own dataset, please follow the way each column and row is defined as in the "exampleData.txt". For the example dataset, the instances from 31 to 35 are noise introduced to the majority class but generated by minority class distribution. Therefore, the goal is to give them a fairly low rank when sampling is applied to select from the majority class. SSOgui.jar is straightforward to use and self-explanatory. Let me know if you need further detail on how to use it. Have fun!
